    <p> The Ruana Archive </p>

    <p> This web page is designed to showcase my family's extensive archival
        pieces so that my family heirlooms don't get lost to time. The user 
        will be able to choose both a person and a type of artifact from 
        various drop down menus. This will then populate items that match that
        query below the drop down menus. If a user chooses a query that is not
        available, a message will appear in the same place. For each artifact
        there is a short description and date attached that can be seen by the 
        reader. This project is unique because it is essentially a digital 
        archive similar to a museum, however, it is interactive drawing people
        together with stories of the past.
