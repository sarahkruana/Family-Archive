# Family-Archive
I designed and built a digital archive system that uses user input to retrieve and populate the website with the certain type of archival pieces that fit the given requirements. It connects a personal website to a series of SQL databases that stores the archived pieces under their classification and associated name. The website then links multiple different pages that explain the purpose, the data, and the creator. It then generates specific pieces that display photos, names, and descriptions based on the users designated classification and person associated. Also resolves common errors such as missing pieces.
