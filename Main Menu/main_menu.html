        Welcome to the Ruana Archive. This project is in dedication to my
        wonderful late grandmother who kept a meticulus record of family 
        heirlooms at her house. Upon clearing out her house, my mom and I 
        discovered boxes and bins full of labeled photographs and more. 
        <br> 
            These
            documents represent my family history, and this archive represents
            the futures ability to reflect on the past.
